### 1. Getting Started <a id="GettingStarted"></a>

#### Important Definitions

-   **Version control:** A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later.
-   **Distributed version control:** A version control system where every user has a complete copy of the repository, instead of relying on a central server.
-   **Working directory:** The directory on your local machine where you are currently working on files in a Git repository.
-   **Repository:** A collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git.

#### Important Points

-   **Git** is a **distributed version control** system designed for speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
-   Git stores data as **snapshots** of the entire repository at particular points in time.
-   Files in Git have three main states: **committed, modified, and staged**.
-   Git has a command-line interface as well as graphical user interface tools.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository |
| `git clone [url]` | Clones a remote repository to your local machine |
| `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` | Sets your name for Git |
| `git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"` | Sets your email for Git |

---

### 2. Git Basics <a id="Basics"></a>

#### Important Definitions

-   **Commit:** A snapshot of the repository at a particular point in time.
-   **SHA-1:** A cryptographic hash function used by Git to uniquely identify each commit and object in the repository.
-   **Staging area:** A space where you can prepare changes before committing them to the repository.
-   **Remote repository:** A copy of a repository that is located on a server or other remote location.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git status` | Shows the status of the working directory |
| `git add [file]` | Adds changes to the staging area |
| `git reset [file]` | Unstages a file or resets the repository to a previous commit |
| `git checkout -- [file]` | Discards changes in the working directory. **This operation is unrecoverable** |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commits changes to the repository with a message |
| `git commit --amend` | Amends the last commit with the staged changes |
| `git log` | Shows the commit history |
| `git log -[limit]` | Limits the number of commits shown by [limit] |
| `git log --oneline` | Condenses each commit to a single line |
| `git diff [file]` | Shows the changes made to a file |

---

### 3. Git Branching <a id="Branching"></a>

#### Important Definitions

-   **Branch:** A separate line of development in a Git repository that has a pointer to a specific commit.
-   **Merge:** The process of bringing changes from one branch into another.
-   **HEAD:** A reference to the currently checked-out commit in the repository.
-   **Conflict:** A situation where Git is unable to automatically merge changes from two branches.

#### Important Points

-   Branching allows for non-linear development and can be used to work on multiple features simultaneously.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git branch` | Lists all local branches in the repository |
| `git branch -r` | Lists the remote branches for a Git repository |
| `git branch -a` | Lists all branches, both local and remote |
| `git branch [name]` | Creates a new branch with the given name |
| `git checkout [name]` | Switches to the branch with the given name |
| `git checkout -b [name]` | Creates a new branch with the given name and switches to it |
| `git merge [name]` | Merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch |

### 4. Git on the Server <a id="GitOnTheServer"></a>

#### Important Definitions

-   **SSH:** A secure network protocol used for remote access to servers and repositories.
-   **Git protocol:** A lightweight network protocol used by Git for efficient communication between repositories.

#### Important Points

-   Git can be used with a central server or in a distributed model where each user has their own copy of the repository.
-   To host a Git repository on a server, you can use a variety of protocols, including HTTP, SSH, and Git.
-   Git provides hooks that can be used to trigger actions on the server based on certain events.
-   Git provides the `git clone` command to copy a repository from a server to your local machine.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git remote add [name] [url]` | Adds a remote repository with the given name and URL |
| `git remote -v` | Lists all remote repositories |
| `git push [remote] [branch]` | Pushes changes to a remote repository |

| `git fetch [remote]` | Fetches changes from a remote repository |
| `git pull [remote] [branch]` | Pulls changes from a remote repository |

---

### 5. Git Tools <a id="GitTools"></a>

#### Important Points

-   Git provides a variety of tools to help with common tasks, including merging, rebasing, and cherry-picking.
-   Git provides a way to view the changes made to a file over time using the `git blame` command.
-   Git provides a way to search for changes across the repository using the `git grep` command.
-   Git provides the `git stash` command to temporarily store changes.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git stash` | Stashes changes to the working directory |
| `git stash list` | Lists all stashes |
| `git stash apply` | Applies the most recent stash |
| `git stash apply stash@{n}` | Applies the nth stash |
| `git blame [file]` | Shows who made each change to a file and when |
| `git reflog` | Shows a log of all Git references |
| `git reset [file]` | Unstages a file or resets the repository to a previous commit |
| `git revert [commit]` | Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a specific commit |
| `git cherry-pick [commit]` | Applies the changes of a specific commit onto the current branch <br> (useful if you want to apply changes from one branch onto another without merging the entire branch) |
| `git cherry-pick --abort` | Aborts the cherry-pick process and restores the branch to its original state |
| `git cherry-pick --continue` | Continues the cherry-pick process after resolving conflicts |
| `git cherry-pick --skip` | Skips the current commit if it has already been applied <br> (Using git cherry-pick --skip can save time and avoid unnecessary conflicts when cherry-picking a range of commits that may include duplicates. However, it's important to keep track of which commits have been cherry-picked to avoid skipping important changes unintentionally) |
| `git clean` | Deletes untracked files from the working directory |

---

### 6. Git Best Practices <a id="GitBestPractices"></a>

-   **Use descriptive commit messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you have made.
-   **Commit early and often:** Committing changes frequently helps you keep track of your progress and makes it easier to undo changes if necessary.
-   **Use branches:** Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. This makes it easier to isolate changes, collaborate with others, and revert changes if necessary.
-   **Keep your repository clean:** Remove unnecessary files and directories from your repository. This reduces the size of your repository and makes it easier to work with.
-   **Use tags:** Use tags to mark important milestones in your project, such as releases or major changes.
-   **Use pull requests:** Use pull requests to review and merge changes contributed by others. This helps ensure that changes are reviewed and tested before they are merged into the main branch.
-   **Use Git hooks:** Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, such as committing changes or pushing changes to a remote repository. Use Git hooks to automate tasks such as running tests, checking code style, and generating documentation.
-   **Use Git aliases:** Git aliases are shortcuts for Git commands. Use Git aliases to save time and make it easier to remember complex commands.

### 7. Git Comparisons <a id="GitComparisons"></a>

#### Git vs GitHub

| | **Git** | **GitHub** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A distributed version control system. | A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. |
| **Pull Requests** | Not supported by Git alone. | Supported through the GitHub web interface. |
| **Issue Tracking** | Not supported by Git alone. | Supported through the GitHub web interface. |
| **User Management** | It lacks a user management feature. | It has a built-in user management feature. |
| **Project Management** | Not supported by Git alone. | Supports project management through GitHub Projects and Boards. |
| **Cost** | Free and open-source. | Free for public repositories, paid plans for private repositories with additional features. |
| **Popularity** | Widely used in the software development industry. | One of the most popular web-based hosting services for Git repositories. |
| **Desktop Interface** | Its desktop interface is named Git Gui. | Its desktop interface is named GitHub Desktop. |

#### `git push -u [remote] [branch]` vs `git push [remote] [branch]`

| `git push -u [remote] [branch]` | `git push [remote] [branch]` |
| :--- | :--- |
| Used to push changes to a remote branch and set up a tracking relationship between the local and remote branches. | Used to push changes to a remote branch without setting up a tracking relationship. |
| The **(-u or --set-upstream)** option is required the first time you push changes to a remote branch to set up the tracking relationship. | The -u option is not required. |
| By setting up tracking relationships, you can streamline your workflow and avoid having to specify the remote and branch names each time you push or pull changes. | You will need to specify the remote and branch names each time using the `git push [remote] [branch]` command because Git will not know which remote branch corresponds to the local branch. |

#### `git merge [name]` vs `git merge --no-ff [name]`

| | **`git merge [name]`** | **`git merge --no-ff [name]`** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Merge Type** | Fast-forward merge if possible, otherwise creates a merge commit. | Always creates a merge commit. |
| **Commit History** | Simple commit history, less detailed. | Detailed commit history, shows when a branch was merged and which commits were included in the merge. |
| **Use Cases** | Best for simple merges or when a fast-forward merge is desired. | Useful for tracking changes and understanding how the codebase has evolved over time. |

#### Annotated Tags vs Lightweight Tags

| | **Annotated Tags** | **Lightweight Tags** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object Type** | A full object in Git's object database. | A reference to a commit. |
| **Metadata** | Contains additional metadata such as a tagging message, tagger name, email, and GPG signature. | No additional metadata. |
| **Size** | Larger size due to additional metadata. | Smaller size due to lack of metadata. |
| **Recommended Use** | Recommended for most use cases. | Use when only a simple reference to a commit is needed. |
| **Creation Command** | `git tag -a [name] [commit]` | `git tag [name] [commit]` |

#### `git log` vs `git reflog`

| **`git log`** | **`git reflog`** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Shows the commit history of the current branch or a specified branch. | Shows the history of all the local references, including deleted branches and commits that are no longer reachable. |
| Displays a list of commits in reverse chronological order. | Displays a list of all the changes made to the repository's references, including branches and tags. |
| Shows the commit message, author, date, and hash for each commit. | Shows the reference name, hash, and commit message for each change to a reference. |
| Can be filtered by various options, such as author, date range, and file path. | Does not support filtering options. |
| Can be used to generate a patch or diff for a specific commit. | Does not support generating patches or diffs. |
| Useful for reviewing the history of a branch and understanding the changes made over time. | Useful for recovering lost commits or branches and understanding the history of the repository's references. |
| Can be used with various options and flags, such as `--graph` and `--oneline`, to customize the output. | Does not support customization options or flags. |
| Can be used with various commands, such as `git blame` and `git cherry-pick`, to perform different operations on the commits. | Does not support performing operations on the references. |

### 8. GitLab vs Git <a id="GitVsGitLab"></a>

| | **Git** | **GitLab** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A distributed version control system. | A web-based service and a complete DevOps lifecycle. |
| **Primary Use** | Managing local and remote code. | Hosting repositories, project management, CI/CD, and more. |
| **Environment** | Primarily a command-line interface. | A full web interface with integrated tools. |
| **CI/CD** | Does not support it directly. | Provides a powerful, built-in CI/CD system (GitLab CI/CD). |
| **Project Management** | Does not support it. | Provides boards for tracking issues and tasks. |
| **Installation** | Installed on the local machine. | Can be self-hosted or used as a cloud service. |

---

### 9. Merge vs Rebase <a id="MergeVsRebase"></a>

-   **Git Merge:** A non-destructive way to merge changes. It keeps a full historical record, including every merge commit, which clearly shows when branches were joined together.
-   **Git Rebase:** Rewrites the history. It moves a series of commits from one branch to another, creating a clean, linear history. This makes the commit history look more organized, but it can be dangerous on public branches because it changes the hashes of the commits.

    <li><strong>اكتب رسائل تأكيد واضحة:</strong> خلي الرسائل قصيرة وواضحة توضح التغييرات اللي عملتها.</li>
    <li><strong>أكد مبكر وبشكل متكرر:</strong> تأكيد التغييرات كتير بيساعدك تتابع تقدمك ويسهل ترجع لتغييرات سابقة.</li>
    <li><strong>استخدم الفروع:</strong> خلي فرع لكل ميزة أو إصلاح خطأ. يسهل عزل التغييرات والتعاون مع الناس.</li>
    <li><strong>نظف المستودع:</strong> شيل الملفات والمجلدات الغير ضرورية، يقلل حجم المستودع ويسهل الشغل.</li>
    <li><strong>استخدم الوسوم (tags):</strong> حط علامة على المعالم المهمة زي الإصدارات أو تغييرات كبيرة.</li>
    <li><strong>استخدم Pull Requests:</strong> لمراجعة ودمج تغييرات اللي الناس بتساهم بيها. يساعد على اختبار ومراجعة التغييرات قبل دمجها.</li>
    <li><strong>استخدم Git hooks:</strong> سكربتات بتشتغل تلقائي عند أحداث معينة زي التأكيد أو الدفع. ممكن تستخدمها لتشغيل الاختبارات أو فحص الكود.</li>
    <li><strong>استخدم Git aliases:</strong> اختصارات لأوامر Git لتوفير وقتك وتسهيل تذكر الأوامر الطويلة.</li>
